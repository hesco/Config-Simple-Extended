Revision history for Config-Simple-Extended

0.10    Fri Jan 11 00:09:39 EST 2013
        Now uses ->param(), ->vars() and ->get_block() methods 
        for overloading, rather than addressing internal data 
        structure directly.  This is intended to make this 
        module less fragile to changes in inherited Config::Simple.  
        Now also uses File::PathInfo to provide an absolute path 
        and interacts with config files using an absolute path.  
        Also accepts a debug key on the interface, using that to be 
        informative about what it is up to.
